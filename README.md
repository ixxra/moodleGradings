#fillGrading
##About

This is a hack on moodle. It is not meant to be a full blown app, but a fast and dirty way to update my gradings.


###Update:

I think this should be a more robust way to update gradings, but not that funny ;-)

##Usage:

I use to grade my students exams by hand, and then update their qualifications marks in a master spreadsheet.

In order to update their marks in moodle, I do the following:

From the spreadsheet, generate a csv file with two columns: `email,grading`

Then, I use `grades.js` to generate a json object with the grading indexed by email.

Open moodle with chrome, and go to the corresponding homework, in 'fast grading' mode.

After firing up chromes' console, I paste the json object generated by grades.js, and assign it to a variable named `grades`.

Then, I copy and paste the content of `fillGrading.js` in Chromes' console, and that's it. Gradings are updated from csv to the webpage, and ready to commit, after checking there aren't errors.
